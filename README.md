# JavaScript Assignment 2

### Overview

In this assignment, I created a Trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML. 



### How it works

* When you click start, you will see a list of trivia questions.

* You will have a limited amount of time to finish the quiz. 

* The game ends when the time runs out or if you answer all questions. The page will reveal the number of questions that you answer correctly and incorrectly.

* You will not be able to pick more than one answer per question.

* The countdown timer will let you know how much time you have left.
